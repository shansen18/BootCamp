# Personal Projects

This section is all about my personal projects that I have done outside of my class. This includes things such as my network setup, projects I've done on my server, and walk throughs on how to do them. I hope you find this information interesting and that it help you in your own projects. 

First I want to let you know the specs of my laptop, which I currently run multiple virtual machines on. 

Lenoval Legion Laptop
Processor: AMD Ryzen 7 4800H  2.90 GHz
Memory 64GB 
1TB SDD Hard drive

This laptop was designed to be a gaming computer, but I wanted it for the class I was taking, and so I could run multiple virtual machines at the same time. This is great because I have a Kali linux virtual box, so I can attack machines from vulnhub.  I will go more into that in another section. 

So lets get down to the projects.
