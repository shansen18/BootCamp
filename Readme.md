# Scott Hansen's Cybersecurity Portfolio. 

Welcome to my portfolio. In here you will find the many projects I worked on during my Cybersecurity bootcamp put on by the University of Minnesota. This readme will give a brief description of the homework, and what was to be learned, as well as a link to that weeks Readme file, which acts as the submission file for the homework. 

Please understand that at the beginning of this class I had no experience wth github, so things may not be as professional as one would hope. 

## Week 1 Security 101
During Week one we focused on some definitions such as the CIA triad, cybersecurity. We also looked at possible careers in the cybersecurity field and what certificates they require. There was also some setup of our virtual machines during this week. 

For the homework we read 4 Internet security threat reports, and answered some questions on them.

## Week 2 Governance, Risk, and Compliance

During this week we focused on the Risk and Compliance side of the cybersecurity. What can and can't be done, what rule must be followed. We also covered some regulations such as HIPPA and PCI. We also covered a companies management structure, and what each area deals with when it comes to cybersecurity. 

For this weeks homework we wrote up a a brief assessment of a fake companies security culture, and what training could happen to change it, as well as who would need to be involved.

## Week 3 Terminal and Bash

During this week we worked on the fundamentals of Linux. This including how to navigate the command line. Some of these basic commands are: ls, cd, mkdir, touch, grep, awk, head and tail. We also learned how to use nano to edit files.

For this weeks homework we played the part of an investigator at a casino trying to correlate who was playing at certain tables and the dealer at those tables during that time, and if there was any losses and how much.

## Week 4 Linux SysAdmin Fundamentals

In this week we focused on some of the fundamentals of Linux administration. Some of these things were to manage processes with the command top, ps, and kill, and how to manage and monitor the services. We also went over apt install, file permissions. Other things we learned was to use sudo to elevate privileges, create and mange users and groups. 

For this weeks homework we ensured permissions to sensitive Linux files, created new users and groups, and placed the new users in the new group. We also ran a report from Lynis, to audit the system and see what can be done to further harden it from attacks.

## Week 5 Archiving and Logging Data

During this week we mainly focused on backup and restoring data with the Tar command. We also expanded on the idea of backup be using cron to schedule backup jobs as well as log size management using logrotate. We also installed and configured audit rules using auditd. 

For this weeks homework we created a tarfile that excludes a directory, wrote some bash scripts for system usage report, manged log files, and sizes, and created an auditing system.
