## Week 2 Governance Risk and Compliance

During this week we focused on the Risk and Compliance side of the cybersecurity. What can and can't be done, what rule must be followed. We also covered some regulations such as HIPPA and PCI. We also covered a companies management structure, and what each area deals with when it comes to cybersecurity. 

For this weeks homework we wrote up a a brief assessment of a fake companies security culture, and what training could happen to change it, as well as who would need to be involved.

## Week 9 Networking Fundamentals II and CTF

During this week we focused mainly on Wireshark and Pcap analysis and nslookup. We also used Aircrack-ng to obtain wireless keys and decrypt the data. During day 3, we did some CTFs based off Wireshark pcaps. 

During this weeks homework we used nslookup and wireshark to figure out why mail was no longer getting to the servers. 

[Week 9 Submission File](https://github.com/shansen18/BootCamp/blob/9f6d93caa4ba4ac254fdc116a0428b74ecf64eca/Week09/README.md)




## Week 10 Cryptography

During this week we focused on the concepts involved with cryptography. These included basic transcription, and substitution ciphers. We were introduced to the Pain model: Privacy, Authentication, Integrity, Non-Repudiation. We used Open SSL to encrypt and decrypt messages, used hashes to validate the integrity of data. We also also used tools such as Hashcat, and Steghide.


For this weeks homework we visited a cryptography webpage and had to solve several riddles. There was no submission file, just the flags, and a picture of the last page. Both of those and an offline version of the webpage can be found at :

## Week 11 Network Security

This week we focused on network security. We examined the relationship between ports and services, including the role open ports play as the principal attack surface of networked machines. Then, we covered how firewalls are used to control access to a machine's open ports. We also covered intrusion detection systems and network security monitoring, and performed some network forensics. 


For week 11 homework I answered several questions about IDS, the cyber kill chain, firewall archtectures, analyzed Snort rules, and worked with FirewallD rules within our Ubuntu Virtual machine.

## Week 12 Cloud Security and Virtualization

This week we focused we were introduced to Cloud computing and Virtualization. We were also introduced to the concept of Docker and Containers, as well Ansible, and the Yaml language. We used a trial version of Microsoft Azure to setup a small network. This network started with a Resource group, then we added a firewall and rules to secure this network, then we setup 4 machines. The first machine was a jumpbox, where we could remote connect into using SSH, and from there connect to the other machines. We then added two more machines, that ran the DVWA website using Ansible and Containers. We then created a load balancing machine, to control the previous two machines hosting the DVWA webpage. What this did was to create redundancy so if machine 1 would fail machine 2 would take over. 


For this weeks homework, we simply had to create a drawing in Draw.io of the network layout and how everything connected to eachother.

## Week 13 Elk Stack Project

This week we focused on our first project, the Elk Stack Project. During this week we took our virtual network we created last week a step further, and added an Elk stack server to monitor the network. We again used the concepts of Ansible, and Docker to deploy this server, as well as deploy Filebeat and Metricbeat.


The homework for this week focused on deploying the Elk stack server, as well focusing on creating documents in Github.

## Week 15 Web Vulnerabilities and Hardening

This week we focused on different types of attacks that can be directed at web applications. This included attacks such as XXS injection, SQL injection, directory traversals, file inclusion attacks, as well as conduct a brute force attack against a web app login with Burp Suite. We also leaned how to use Foxy proxy, and Burp Suites together to analyze HTTP requests, as well as modifying the data using the Burp Suite Repeater. 


During this weeks homework we used our virtual machine perform a command injection, a brute force attack as well as Cross site scripting. After I proved the proof of concept, I wrote how to mitigate and protect from the attack.

** Please note, any malicious activity was done against virtual machines hosted in my virtualbox. No Laws were broken. **


## Week 16 Penetration Testing

During this week we focused on the concept such as OSINT (open source information intelligence), as well as tools like NMAP used for network enumeration, or finding out what's vulnerable on the network. We then took it further and searched for any exploits using searchsploit. 

During this weeks homework we performed some OSINT on demo.testfire.net, which is a fictional company with a real website for use in demonstrations in Cyber Security. We then ran Zenmap (or NMAP) against one of our virtual machines setup for penetration testing. 

** Please note, any malicious activity was done against virtual machines hosted in my virtualbox. No Laws were broken. **

## Week 17 Penetration Testing 2

During this week we focused on using nmap to scan ports for potential vulnerabilities. We also Focused on Metasploit, and how to load modules, view the modules information, and modify them to focus on a victims computer. We also learned about Meterpreter, and how to deliver the payload that opens an instance of Meterpreter in the victims computer memory, as well as some commands to use in Meterpreter to interact with the victims computer. 


During this weeks homework we were tasked to perform a penetration test against a fictional CEO's computer, simulated by using a virtual computer loaded with the Icecast vulnerability. We then had to write a report on what we found and how this vulnerability could be resolved.

## Week 18 SEIM 1

During this week we learned about SEIMs. This included what SEIM vendors are out there, and how SEIM's work. We also got introduced to Splunk. In Splunk we learned how to upload data, and write SQL queries to analyze the data. We also learned how to create new fields, schedule reports, and schedule alerts if an attack occurs. 

During this week's homework we acted as a SOC analyst hired to analyze a DDOS attack, and design alerts to the SOC team in case it happens again. 

[Week 18 Homework](https://github.com/shansen18/BootCamp/blob/e8b480ce3c7a7e5ec6953a341cd984a056bcd734/Week18/Readme.md)

## Week 19 SEIM 2

During this week we continued to focus on SEIM's specifically Splunk. During this time we learned about using the data to create dashboards and ways to visualize the data. We also learned how to create a Heatmap using  We also continued to expand on the knowledge of Splunk that was learned in Week 18. 


During this week's homework we worked with SPlunk to analyze and attack on a company, by examining the attack logs. This was a little difficult as the data was created long ago, however we overcame this issue by adjusting the time range to narrowly focus the time range into the date when the attack was simulated. 

[Week 19 Homework](https://github.com/shansen18/BootCamp/blob/01fd700c91df4c5f05c9550ffcb9f4ae9d716a91/Week19/Readme.md)


## Red vs Blue project

During this week we focused on our second project, working on it during class time. See below for the description of the project. 

An Azure machine with 3 computer in Hyper-V, networked together. A virtual network in a virtual machine. One computer was a Kali Linux machine used as an attacker. The second Hyper-V machine was setup to be a web server, that was setup to be the victim. The third Hyper-V machine was an ELK server, used to identify the attack. The first part of this project, the class acted as the Red Team, and analyzed
the web server for vulnerabilities, and exploit them. This was done by using Metasploit to create payload which allowed for reverse shell connection that was used to exfiltrate data off that server. The second half, The class acted as the Blue team to analyze the signature of
the attack. From there advise was given on what could be done to mitigate this type of attack from happening again.

## Week 21 Forensics

During this week we learned about digital forensics. Things focused on during this week are identifying, extracting, preserving, and reporting on information obtained from computer and network systems. During this week we also learned about smartphone forensic investigations (specifically the Apple IPhone). This included programs used to extract and view the phone data. The structure of the IPhone database. We also learned how to tag and export evidence from the phone, and then examining some of it with sqlitebrowser. 

This weeks homework we performed a digital forensic analysis of an Iphone's data. This homework was based on the National Gallery Exercise, however rather than looking at the overall scenario, we focused specifically on Tracy's IPhone, and how it related to the stamp theft.
