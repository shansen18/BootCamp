## Week 2 Governance Risk and Compliance

During this week we focused on the Risk and Compliance side of the cybersecurity. What can and can't be done, what rule must be followed. We also covered some regulations such as HIPPA and PCI. We also covered a companies management structure, and what each area deals with when it comes to cybersecurity. 

For this weeks homework we wrote up a a brief assessment of a fake companies security culture, and what training could happen to change it, as well as who would need to be involved.

## Week 4 Linux SysAdmin Fundamentals

In this week we focused on some of the fundamentals of Linux administration. Some of these things were to manage processes with the command top, ps, and kill, and how to manage and monitor the services. We also went over apt install, file permissions. Other things we learned was to use sudo to elevate privileges, create and mange users and groups. 

For this weeks homework we ensured permissions to sensitive Linux files, created new users and groups, and placed the new users in the new group. We also ran a report from Lynis, to audit the system and see what can be done to further harden it from attacks.

## Week 10 Cryptography

During this week we focused on the concepts involved with cryptography. These included basic transcription, and substitution ciphers. We were introduced to the Pain model: Privacy, Authentication, Integrity, Non-Repudiation. We used Open SSL to encrypt and decrypt messages, used hashes to validate the integrity of data. We also also used tools such as Hashcat, and Steghide.


For this weeks homework we visited a cryptography webpage and had to solve several riddles. There was no submission file, just the flags, and a picture of the last page. Both of those and an offline version of the webpage can be found at :

## Week 11 Network Security

This week we focused on network security. We examined the relationship between ports and services, including the role open ports play as the principal attack surface of networked machines. Then, we covered how firewalls are used to control access to a machine's open ports. We also covered intrusion detection systems and network security monitoring, and performed some network forensics. 


For week 11 homework I answered several questions about IDS, the cyber kill chain, firewall archtectures, analyzed Snort rules, and worked with FirewallD rules within our Ubuntu Virtual machine.

## Week 12 Cloud Security and Virtualization

This week we focused we were introduced to Cloud computing and Virtualization. We were also introduced to the concept of Docker and Containers, as well Ansible, and the Yaml language. We used a trial version of Microsoft Azure to setup a small network. This network started with a Resource group, then we added a firewall and rules to secure this network, then we setup 4 machines. The first machine was a jumpbox, where we could remote connect into using SSH, and from there connect to the other machines. We then added two more machines, that ran the DVWA website using Ansible and Containers. We then created a load balancing machine, to control the previous two machines hosting the DVWA webpage. What this did was to create redundancy so if machine 1 would fail machine 2 would take over. 


For this weeks homework, we simply had to create a drawing in Draw.io of the network layout and how everything connected to eachother.

## Week 13 Elk Stack Project

This week we focused on our first project, the Elk Stack Project. During this week we took our virtual network we created last week a step further, and added an Elk stack server to monitor the network. We again used the concepts of Ansible, and Docker to deploy this server, as well as deploy Filebeat and Metricbeat.


The homework for this week focused on deploying the Elk stack server, as well focusing on creating documents in Github.

## Week 15 Web Vulnerabilities and Hardening

This week we focused on different types of attacks that can be directed at web applications. This included attacks such as XXS injection, SQL injection, directory traversals, file inclusion attacks, as well as conduct a brute force attack against a web app login with Burp Suite. We also leaned how to use Foxy proxy, and Burp Suites together to analyze HTTP requests, as well as modifying the data using the Burp Suite Repeater. 


During this weeks homework we used our virtual machine perform a command injection, a brute force attack as well as Cross site scripting. After I proved the proof of concept, I wrote how to mitigate and protect from the attack.

** Please note, any malicious activity was done against virtual machines hosted in my virtualbox. No Laws were broken. **


## Week 16 Penetration Testing

During this week we focused on the concept such as OSINT (open source information intelligence), as well as tools like NMAP used for network enumeration, or finding out what's vulnerable on the network. We then took it further and searched for any exploits using searchsploit. 

During this weeks homework we performed some OSINT on demo.testfire.net, which is a fictional company with a real website for use in demonstrations in Cyber Security. We then ran Zenmap (or NMAP) against one of our virtual machines setup for penetration testing. 

** Please note, any malicious activity was done against virtual machines hosted in my virtualbox. No Laws were broken. **

## Week 17 Penetration Testing 2

During this week we focused on using nmap to scan ports for potential vulnerabilities. We also Focused on Metasploit, and how to load modules, view the modules information, and modify them to focus on a victims computer. We also learned about Meterpreter, and how to deliver the payload that opens an instance of Meterpreter in the victims computer memory, as well as some commands to use in Meterpreter to interact with the victims computer. 


During this weeks homework we were tasked to perform a penetration test against a fictional CEO's computer, simulated by using a virtual computer loaded with the Icecast vulnerability. We then had to write a report on what we found and how this vulnerability could be resolved.
