#Scott Hansens Cybersecurity Portfolio. 

Welcome to my portfolio. In here you will find the many projects I worked on during my Cybersecurity bootcamp put on by the University of Minnesota. This readme will give a brief discription of the homework, and what was to be learned, as well as a link to that weeks Readme file, which acts as the submission file for the homework. 

Please understand that at the begining of this class I had no experience wth github, so things may not be as professional as one would hope. 

##Week 1 Security 101
During Week one we focused on some defenitions such as the CIA triad, cybersecurity. We also looked at possable careers in the cybersecurity field and what certificates they require. There was also some setup of our virtual machines during this week. 

For the homework we read 4 Internet security threat reports, and answered some questions on them.

During this week we focused on the Risk and Compliance side of the cybersecurity. What can and can't be done, what rule must be followed. We also covered some regulations such as HIPPA and PCI. We also covered a companies management structure, and what each area deals with when it comes to cybersecurity. 

For this weeks homework we wrote up a a breif assesment of a fake companies security culture, and what trainging could haapen to change it, as well as who would need to be involved.

During this week we worked on the fundementals of Linux. This including how to navigate the command line. Some of these basic commands are: ls, cd, mkdir, touch, grep, awk, heand and tail. We also learned how to use nano to edit files.

For this weeks homework we played the part of an investigator at a casino trying to corrolate who was playing at certain tables and the dealer at those tables during that time, and if there was any losses and how much.
