# Security 101 Homework: Security Reporting
## Part I: Symantec
For Part 1 of your homework assignment, you should primarily use the Symantec Internet Security Threat Report along with independent research to answer the following questions.

1. What is formjacking? Basically it's injecting a malicious JavaScript code onto a companies form on a website, this allows the attacker to recieve a copy of information that an individual fills out on said form. According to Symantic it typically is directed at small or medium retailers. I believe the reason for this is that smaller retailers may not have the security practices as large retailers. 

2. How many websites are compromised each month with formjacking code? 4818


3. What is Powershell? According to the Microsoft webpage a PowerShell is a cross-platform task automation solution made up of a command-line shell, a scripting language, and a configuration management framework. PowerShell runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS. 
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview?view=powershell-7.1

4. What was the annual percentage increase in malicious Powershell scripts? 1000%


5. What is a coinminer? A coinminer is a program that uses the processing power of a computer mine cryptocoins to solve hashes. A cryptominer commonly uses the unused processors in a video card or the GPU. 


6. How much can data from a single credit card can be sold for? Up to around 45$


7. How did Magecart successfully attack Ticketmaster? Through a thirdparty chatbot, they used it to inject their code onto Ticketmasters customers browsers. 

8. What is one reason why there has been a growth of formjacking?  Symantec believe that the drop in value of crypto during that year made it more lucrative to steal credit cards than to mine crypto. 


9. Cryptojacking dropped by what percentage between January and December 2018? by about 52%


10. If a web page contains a coinmining script, what happens? It will basically highjack the cpu of the visitor to that webpage. So that as long as they have the page open the computer will be used to mine crypto. 


11. How does an exploit kit work? An Exploit kit is a program that uses known exploits in systems or applications, this is why it is important to keep all aplications and operating systems up to date. 


12. What does the criminal group SamSam specialize in? They specialize in ransomware attacks. This is where a computer or network is made unusable until victim pays a ransom to regain control. 


13. How many SamSam attacks did Symantec find evidence of in 2018? 67 attacks


14. Even though ransomware attacks declined in 2017-2018, what was one dramatic change that occurred?  Ransomware attacks moved away from the average consumers to large enterprises. 


15. In 2018, what was the primary ransomware distribution method? Through email attacks


16. What operating systems do most types of ransomware attacks still target? Microsoft Windows.


17. What are “living off the land” attacks? What is the advantage to hackers?  This attack uses a feature in a program or operating system to conduct the attack. The advantage of this attack that the feature or tool is already created and ready to be used. 


18. What is an example of a tool that’s used in “living off the land” attacks? The use of windows task scheduler to ran a malicious code at a given time. 


19. What are zero-day exploits? The use of a vulnrability in a program that is not currently known by the developer of the program.


20. By what percentage did zero-day exploits decline in 2018? by 4% from 27% to 23%


21. What are two techniques that worms such as Emotet and Qakbot use? Either brute forcing or retrieving passwords from memory in order to gain access to the network through shared files. 


22. What are supply chain attacks? By how much did they increase in 2018? the use of third parties software to infect the attackers main target.  A good example of this was outlined in question 7. The use of the third parties chatbot.


23. What challenge do supply chain attacks and living off the land attacks highlight for organizations? Both forms of attacks are difficult because the orginization doesn't develop the software, they have to trust that the developer has identified and fixed most of the vulnrabilities in their software and will constantly do so as more are discoverd. 


24. The 20 most active groups tracked by Symantec targeted an average of how many organizations between 2016 and 2018? 55 orginizations

In this part, you should primarily use the Verizon Data Breaches Investigation Report plus independent research to answer the below questions.

1. What is the difference between an incident and a breach?  
Incident: A security event that compromises the integrity, confidentiality or availability of an information asset. 
Breach: An incident that results in the confirmed disclosure—not just potential exposure—of data to an unauthorized party

Denial of Service: A denial-of-service (DoS) attack is an intentional cyberattack carried out on networks, websites, and online resources to restrict access to its legitimate users. This is usually done by overloading the target network or site with fake system requests, preventing legitimate users from accessing it, sometimes crashing or damaging a system outright.

Command and Control : is an attack where the attcker is trying to take control of compromised systems. 

Backdoor: A hole in a security system deliberatly left by the programmers or deisnigners. This is not an inharently bad thing, as it can give them a way in when everything else is locked out. 

Keylogger:  This a form of of software that is used to track key strokes. This is useful when trying to gain the victims passwords.
