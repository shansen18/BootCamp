# Week 2 Homework: Assessing Security Culture 

## Step 1: Measure and Set Goals
Answer the following questions:

1. Using outside research, indicate the potential security risks of allowing employees to access work information on their personal devices. Identify at least three potential attacks that can be carried out. 
Although not truly an attack in the way our class is looking at it, I would have to think that the number 1 security risk is a lost or stolen device. As we all know people are lazy and may not properly lock down their personal device, thus allowing the person who obtains the device to easily access company information. 
Malware attacks on personal devices. If the user is using a phone they may download an app that unknown to them access their personal information or data stored on that phone. A personal computer may not have the latest updates or security patches installed leaving it open to a malware attack. 
Insider attack, if the employees are using their own personal devices it would be very easy for employees with access to confidential material to copy it without admins knowing that it has been copied. A good example of this is a screen shot on a phone, or taking a photo of the screen with another device. Even though the later could be done in the office, you're more likely not to get caught if you do it at home. 

2. Based on the above scenario, what is the preferred employee behavior?
Everyone looses their phone from time to time, so the preferred behavior would be to report any lost or stolen phones to the company within 24 hrs. This should give the employee enough time to search and find the phone. 
The preferred behavior for this is for the employee to keep software up to date, and read the terms of service agreements for the programs they install, and not install them if the terms are questionable, or talk to the IT department if the user needs the app. 
The preferred behavior would be for the employee not to take screen shots of confidential data. 

3. What methods would you use to measure how often employees are currently not behaving according to the preferred behavior?
So the way I can think of to measure how often employees are in compliance with reporting a lost device, is by only allowing authorized mac address onto the network, and see how many times unauthorized mac tries to access the network before a device is reported lost or stolen. 
For software updates I think this could be a little more tricky, the only way I could see this a company doing this is through Mobile device management, that would allow the IT department to see what programs are installed and if they are up to date. I could see this as a random selection of devices, done quarterly. 
For taking screenshots, I do not think that a measurement would be possible. Even if a mobile device manager prevented screenshots, the user could still take pictures on another device. 

4. What is the goal that you would like the organization to reach regarding this behavior?
For lost or stolen device, I think the goal would be less than 3% try and hide that they lost or had their device stolen. The user would by themselves try and make the issue of just having the device lost or stolen be 0%
For software being out of date I can see this be around 10% don't run updates. Updating can take time, and the employee may not know there is updates out there. Also for some mobile devices I believe it's better to wait a week or two after an OS update comes out before updating the devices OS. This helps mitigate any critical bugs the update may have. 
For theft of confidential documents, I think it is reasonable to get to 0% by only allowing access to those files on in office devices. 


# Step 2: Involve the Right People

Now that you have a goal in mind, who needs to be involved?
Director of Cybersecurity. They would need to approve the plan, and move it up the chain of command in the company. They would also have to work to secure any funding needed as well as work with the legal department in order to make sure that the changes were legal and wouldn't violate any laws. 
HR department. They will need to be involved because this would involve changes to company policies, and they would have to make sure that the employees are aware of this. This also includes training, and answering questions by the user. 
The CIO:  They would most likely director of Cybersecurity would pass this proposal to, as this impacts every employee at the company, including the CEO. The CIO needs to be made aware of any changes to the IT department or their needs. 
The COO would need to be involved as well as they are in charge of the daily business operations. Again as any changes to the policy of using personal devices for work has far reaching affect to the operations of the company the COO would need to know about it and give approval. 
The CEO would need to know about any changes that affect the company as a whole, so he can report them to the board of directors. He would inform the board of the reasons why the changes are being made, how it will affect the company and most likely the cost to the company. 

# Step 3: Training Plan

Training is part of any security culture framework plan. How will you train your employees on this security concern? In one page, indicate the following:
How frequently will you run training? What format will it take? Having sat through many of these trainings, I think biannual online training for these topics would be best. This will keep the information in the trainings not only up to date, but also fresh in the memory of the employees, at the same time not being over bearing. 

What topics will you cover in your training and why? I would cover lost devices, malware, phishing, using the risk of using public wifi's, vpn usage, and mobile device manager, most likely in that order. 
The training I would give for the lost device, malware, phishing and using public WiFi, would be to give the problem with them, and then an example (IE Sally lost her phone and didn't report it, some one found it and was able to access customers PII and sold it on the dark-web) after that I would give a way to prevent that attack. 
The VPN I would define what it is and what it does, and how to access it from the employees device. 
For the mobiles device manager, I would inform the employee of what it is, what it is allowed to access on their device, and what it is allowed to do. This would give the employee the knowledge they would need if they wanted to opt out of using it, which means opting out of using their own device. 
After each section I would have a form that they would acknowledge saying that they have received the training and failure to abide by the policies may result in some form of disciplinary action. This allows managers and upper management to say that their employees have gone through the training and are aware of the company policies. 

After youâ€™ve run your training, how will you measure its effectiveness? I would run a fishing campaign yearly, and not around the same time every year to measure that training. Malware I think you could do the same thing just with a thumb-drive, that automatically locks the computer until a code is given by the IT department. 
For things like the VPN, and the lost devices, those can be made to have 100% compliance, by mac address authorizations, and only being able to access files via vpn.
