#### Sessions and Cookies

Recall that HTTP servers need to be able to recognize clients from one another. They do this through sessions and cookies.

Answer the following questions about sessions and cookies:

15. Which response header sends a cookie to the client?

    ```HTTP
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK

In Http headers it's the Set-Cookie that sends a cookie to a client.

    ```HTTP
    GET /cart HTTP/1.1
    Host: www.example.org
    <mark>Cookie</mark>: cart=Bob
    ```
The Cookies: Cart=Bob will continue Bobs session.
